  ul
    li I  can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016).
    li If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.
    li  If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.
  h2.red Example usage:
  p localhost:3000/December%2015,%202015
  p localhost:3000/1450137600
  h2.red Expected Output:
  p { "unix": 1450137600, "natural": "December 15, 2015" }
